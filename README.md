# Calendar

**User** needs to have a simple, interactive **calender** that shows their work day so that they are able to *add* important *events* by the hour and ***manage*** their time more effectively.

**User** will be able to *add* and *change* *events* as needed and will be able to see any *changes* even when they refresh the page.

The **calendar** will keep track of the day by doing the following:

-***past*** time will be GRAY  
-***present*** hour will be RED  
-***future*** time will be GREEN
